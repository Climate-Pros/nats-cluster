# Preload the nats based resolver with the system account jwt.
# This is not necessary but avoids a bootstrapping system account.
# This only applies to the system account. Therefore other account jwt are not included here.
# To populate the resolver:
# 1) make sure that your operator has the account server URL pointing at your nats servers.
#    The url must start with: "nats://"
#    nsc edit operator --account-jwt-server-url nats://localhost:4222
# 2) push your accounts using: nsc push --all
#    The argument to push -u is optional if your account server url is set as described.
# 3) to prune accounts use: nsc push --prune
#    In order to enable prune you must set above allow_delete to true
# Later changes to the system account take precedence over the system account jwt listed here.
